    🔑 How to get your Vercel Token

    Log in to your Vercel account https://vercel.com/login

    Click your profile icon (top-right corner) → Account Settings.

    In the left sidebar, find the section Tokens or API Tokens.

    Click “Create Token”, give it a descriptive name, and choose the permissions you need.

    The token will be shown only once — copy it and store it somewhere safe, because you won’t be able to view it again later.
